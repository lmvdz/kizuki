# Kizuki agent skill catalog

Skills are task-specific playbooks. Keep standing repository policy in `AGENTS.md`; use these files only when the task calls for their deeper workflow. `elegance-review` is the exception: load it for every code change. Canonical skills live here. Harness adapters delegate here. House overlays (`elegance-review` in all three homes; `show-me` in Claude and Cursor) copy the full body.

## Binding context (read before any skill)

Every skill here is subordinate to `docs/CURRENT.md`, `docs/decision-log.md`
and `rfcs/0002-autonomous-canon.md`. Read those three first and treat them as
overriding this catalog and each playbook. No skill, and no work performed
under one, may restate or reintroduce a superseded policy: owner-invoked
promotion as the canon write path, or any owner review queue or approval step
(D9, D10; corrections go through MCP `correct` and `kizuki tell`, D14); owner
labeling of sensitivity (D11); a zero-model floor that writes canon (D12);
a SQLite-only rule for derived retrieval (D13); an owner-started daemon
(D15); or the review gate as the product's moat (C8). Reviewers using
`review-change`, `documentation-accuracy`, `security-privacy-review` or
`release-readiness` must fail any change that reintroduces one.

## Operating skills

| Skill | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `orient-repository` | Starting non-trivial work, recovering a handoff, or checking collision risk |
| `run-lane` | Executing one numbered milestone, module or step from a plan to a deterministic finish line |
| `implement-change` | Building or repairing a bounded behavior |
| `diagnose-failure` | A failure cause is uncertain or a previous fix did not hold |
| `review-change` | Reviewing an exact branch or pull-request head |
| `elegance-review` | House default: every implementation, refactor, or PR review |
| `connector-work` | Researching, implementing, or reviewing a provider connector or importer |
| `security-privacy-review` | Crossing data, auth, filesystem, network, serving, import, or export boundaries |
| `write-rfc` | Changing architecture, authority, durable state, or a binding contract |
| `handoff-work` | Stopping, transferring, or preserving a lane |

## Engineering craft skills

| Skill | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `architecture-design` | Designing or reviewing a subsystem or cross-package architecture |
| `api-contract-design` | Adding or changing a TypeScript, CLI, connector, MCP, or serialized contract |
| `test-strategy` | Designing coverage or strengthening weak behavioral proof |
| `refactor-safely` | Simplifying or modularizing without changing observable behavior |
| `migration-work` | Transforming durable state, formats, dependencies, or many callers |
| `performance-engineering` | Improving latency, throughput, memory, I/O, startup, indexing, or scale |
| `reliability-engineering` | Designing retries, recovery, restart safety, liveness, or degraded operation |
| `sqlite-data-modeling` | Designing durable or derived SQLite schemas, indexes, and queries |
| `dependency-evaluation` | Adding, upgrading, replacing, or removing a dependency |
| `release-readiness` | Deciding whether an exact candidate is genuinely ready to ship |
| `threat-modeling` | Mapping assets, trust boundaries, abuse cases, mitigations, and security tests |
| `property-fuzz-testing` | Exploring large parser, state-machine, serialization, and hostile-input spaces |
| `concurrency-race-analysis` | Reasoning about interleavings, stale state, duplicate work, locks, SQLite, or filesystem races |
| `backup-restore` | Building or verifying backup and clean-target restore |
| `cli-terminal-ux` | Designing safe, composable, polished CLI and terminal interactions |
| `observability-debuggability` | Adding privacy-safe local diagnostics, health, receipts, and failure visibility |
| `documentation-accuracy` | Proving documentation and claims against the exact revision |
| `mcp-tool-design` | Designing agent/MCP tools, schemas, authorization, errors, and bounded context |
| `incident-root-cause` | Investigating defects or incidents into reproducible causes and durable prevention |
| `repository-archaeology` | Recovering intent and constraints from unfamiliar code, history, tests, and RFCs |

## Composition

Use the smallest set that covers the task. `orient-repository` normally comes first. Useful combinations:

- new durable subsystem: `architecture-design` + `api-contract-design` + `sqlite-data-modeling` + `threat-modeling` + `test-strategy`;
- schema evolution: `migration-work` + `sqlite-data-modeling` + `reliability-engineering` + `backup-restore`;
- performance bug: `diagnose-failure` + `performance-engineering` + `property-fuzz-testing` where the input space matters;
- concurrency-sensitive state: `concurrency-race-analysis` + `reliability-engineering` + `test-strategy`;
- MCP serving: `mcp-tool-design` + `threat-modeling` + `api-contract-design` + `security-privacy-review`;
- unfamiliar legacy path: `repository-archaeology` before `refactor-safely`;
- incident: `incident-root-cause` + `diagnose-failure` + the relevant domain skill;
- CLI feature: `cli-terminal-ux` + `api-contract-design` + `test-strategy`;
- release candidate: `review-change` + `security-privacy-review` + `documentation-accuracy` + `release-readiness`.

Load `elegance-review` for every code change, refactor, or PR review. Do not load every other skill by default. Deep playbooks are useful because they are invoked for the right job, not because they occupy permanent prompt context.
