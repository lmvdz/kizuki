# M3 Box lifecycle finish line (docs/deploy-box-tailscale.md "M3 Box golden
# snapshot and one-command setup"). Not CI-runnable: it provisions and tears
# down real Box VMs (box.ascii.dev) and bills per second. Prints one
# `PASS <n> <label>`, `FAIL <n> <label> <reason>` or `BLOCKED <n> <label>
# <reason>` line per check; does not stop at the first failure (later
# checks that do not depend on an earlier one are still worth running), and
# exits non-zero if anything failed or was blocked.
#
# Usage:
#   deploy/proof/box.sh <box-api-key-file> <ts-authkey-file> [ttl-seconds]
#
# Every box this script creates is deleted before it exits, success or
# failure, and the fleet is confirmed empty at the end (printed, not
# asserted as a numbered check, since "the account has no other boxes right
# now" is a precondition of a clean run rather than a property this proof
# itself establishes).

# Reconciling with `docker compose down` first (never `-v`, which would
# destroy the vault volume) on every attempt makes compose own the
# container set instead of racing dockerd for it. That still leaves the
# case where dockerd wins the very next race before `up -d` finishes, so
# each attempt also reads the tailscale service's own logs afterward and
# treats the "missing secret file" symptom as a container to remove and
# replace, not as one to retry against. `up -d` finishing with neither
# symptom is still not proof both services actually stayed up (observed:
# a real proof run once left `kizuki` unreachable for the rest of its 120s
# poll with no Conflict and no secret error in either command's own
# output), so the last step before declaring convergence confirms both
# services report `running`, not just that `up` returned without the two
