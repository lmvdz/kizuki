# Goal plan: Kizuki on a Box behind Tailscale

Status: PLAN (branch `agent/deploy-box-tailscale-20260903`, written
2026-09-03 against `main` at `f152d91`). Nothing in this document is a claim
that any of it is built. Each milestone names a proof script whose exit code
is the finish line. A milestone is done when its proof exits 0 on the exact
head under review, and not before.

Binding context: `docs/CURRENT.md`, `docs/decision-log.md`, RFC 0002. This
plan adds a deployment target. It changes no contract, no invariant and no
policy. Where it touches the CLI (M4, M5) it implements accepted design that
RFC 0002 already names (§12 model configuration, §8.4 `kizuki agent add`).

## 0. Goal

A person who is not the owner runs one command on a fresh Ubuntu VM from
the Box sandbox platform, and within five minutes has a Kizuki that:

1. runs the always-on loop as the container's main process;
2. is reachable only over their tailnet, never over the VM's public IP;
3. syncs a connected source, answers `query` and MCP reads, and takes
   `tell` and `undo`;
4. writes canon with receipts once a model endpoint is configured, and says
   `canon writing: off` in `doctor` until then;
5. loses nothing across container restart, VM stop and VM start;
6. can be torn down with `docker compose down -v`, leaving a readable
   Markdown vault in the export the owner pulled.

Every one of those six sentences is asserted by a script below. There is no
"looks right" step.

## 1. Facts this plan rests on (verified 2026-09-03)

| Fact | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `kizuki serve` binds loopback only and refuses any other host. | `packages/core/src/serve/http.ts` `startServeHttp` |
| The standing endpoint serves `GET /health` unauthenticated and `POST /v1/mcp/<tool>` behind a bearer token minted at start, written 0600, rotated on restart. Agent tokens from `agents` also authenticate. | same file, `principalFor` |
| Inside a container there is no systemd. `KIZUKI_SUPERVISOR=none` forces the "loop runs only while you run it" path. | `packages/core/src/serve/supervisor.ts` `detectSupervisorKind` |
| The serve loop takes `RailHooks { sync, claims, model_ref }`. The CLI `serve` verb passes none, so canon writing is unreachable from the CLI today. | `packages/core/src/serve/rails.ts`, `packages/cli/src/commands/serve.ts` |
| RFC 0002 §12 specifies `[ports] llm = "kizuki.llm.openai-compatible"` plus `[ports.llm] base_url, model, secret_ref`. Nothing reads it yet. | `rfcs/0002-autonomous-canon.md` §12.1 |
| `@kizuki/llm` registers `kizuki.llm.none` and `kizuki.llm.openai-compatible`; a loopback fake endpoint exists for tests. | `packages/llm/src/index.ts`, `packages/llm/test/fake-endpoint.ts` |
| Core has `addAgent`, `setGrant`, `revokeAgent`, `rotateToken`. No CLI verb exposes them. `kizuki-mcp --token-env VAR` exists. | `packages/core/src/agents/identity.ts`, `packages/mcp/src/bin.ts` |
| `import` fails on Windows with `EPERM fsync` because directories are opened for fsync. Out of scope here; Linux is the target. | `packages/core/src/ledger/connection-state-files.ts` `fsyncDirectory` |
| The stranger-proof spec already treats `docker` as its preferred isolation backend. | `docs/wave1/specs/stranger-proof.md` §2.2 |
| `scripts/verify-network.ts` scans `packages/` only; `scripts/verify.sh` scans every tracked file and reachable commit message for the identifier denylist. | `scripts/` |
| CI pins bun 1.3.10 and requires every action to be SHA-pinned. | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `scripts/verify-workflows.ts` |
| Box gives a full Ubuntu VM with Docker, Bun, SSH, snapshots, disk-level forking and a dedicated public IP, billed per second, EU regions. | box.ascii.dev, fetched 2026-09-03 |

## 2. Shape

```
tailnet peer (laptop, harness)
   │  https://kizuki-<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net  (tailscale serve → 127.0.0.1:PORT)
   │  no shell: a hosted box exposes no Tailscale SSH (M2 finding, 2026-09-04)
   ▼
Box VM (Ubuntu, Docker)
 └─ docker compose
     ├─ tailscale   image pinned by digest, TS_USERSPACE=true, TS_STATE_DIR volume,
     │              TS_AUTHKEY from a Docker secret, serve config for /health and /v1/mcp/*
     └─ kizuki      network_mode: service:tailscale, KIZUKI_SUPERVISOR=none,
                    PID 1 = `kizuki serve`, /vault volume, no capabilities, read-only rootfs
```

Two containers share one network namespace, so Kizuki keeps its loopback
rule untouched and the tailscale container is the only thing that can see
the port. Userspace networking needs no `NET_ADMIN` and no `/dev/net/tun`,
which matters on a VM whose Docker daemon we do not configure. Outbound
from Kizuki to a tailnet-hosted model endpoint goes through tailscaled's
SOCKS5 proxy; that is the one place the userspace choice costs something
and M4's proof covers it.

Pledge honesty: tailscaled is network egress from the VM to Tailscale's
control plane and relays. It is outside Kizuki's process and outside the
`packages/` scan, so it does not change the zero phone-home claim about
Kizuki. The deploy guide (M6) says this in one sentence rather than letting
the reader assume the container inherits the pledge.

## 3. Milestones and finish lines

Each proof lives under `deploy/proof/` and is a bash script that prints one
`PASS <check>` or `FAIL <check> <reason>` line per assertion and exits
non-zero on the first failure. Proofs that need a real tailnet or a real
Box run outside CI; their receipts (command, exact head, transcript) go in
the pull request body, and the "CI-runnable" column says which is which.

### M1 Container floor

Files: `deploy/Dockerfile`, `deploy/entrypoint.sh`, `deploy/compose.yml`,
`deploy/proof/container.sh`, `deploy/fixtures/notes/*.md` (synthetic).

Dockerfile: `oven/bun:1.3.10` pinned by digest, `bun install
--frozen-lockfile`, non-root user, `/vault` volume, `ENTRYPOINT
["/entrypoint.sh"]`. Entrypoint: `KIZUKI_SUPERVISOR=none`, `kizuki init
/vault` when `/vault/.kizuki` is absent, then `exec kizuki serve --vault
/vault`.

Finish line, `deploy/proof/container.sh` (CI-runnable, Linux only):

| # | Assertion | How it is decided |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1 | Repeating the build is stable. | `docker build` exits 0 twice against the same context and the two image ids match. Warm cache: `apt-get update` and `bun install` fetch from the network, so a cold build is not byte-reproducible, which is a property of those tools rather than of the Dockerfile. |
| 1.2 | The floor needs no network. | Every check below runs with `--network none`. |
| 1.3 | Loop is PID 1 and alive. | `docker exec` `kizuki serve status --json` reports `pid` 1, `/proc/1` exists, and `doctor.ok` is true. The CLI's status JSON carries `pid`, `supervisor` and `doctor`; the `running`/`lease` fields belong to core's `serveStatus()`, which no CLI verb calls. |
| 1.4 | Health endpoint answers on loopback. | `curl -fsS 127.0.0.1:$PORT/health` inside the container → body `"ok":true`. |
| 1.5 | Nothing listens off loopback. | `ss` is absent from the image, so the check reads `/proc/net/tcp` and `/proc/net/tcp6`: every row in state `0A` must have a loopback local address. |
| 1.6 | Ingest works and fails closed. | `kizuki import markdown-folder --source /fixtures` exits 0 with stdout containing `events_stored=3` and `errors=0`; `kizuki query acme --scope ledger` exits 0, prints nothing on stdout, and its stderr contains `withheld=`; a second identical import exits 0 with stdout containing `events_stored=0` and `duplicates=3`. |
| 1.7 | Doctor is honest. | `kizuki doctor` output contains `supervisor: none` and `canon writing: off`, and no rail line contains `status=failed` or `status=down`. `RailDoctor.status` is `ok`, `down` or `idle`, so the literal `failed` this plan first named can never appear; `down` is the real unhealthy value and is checked too. |
| 1.8 | State survives restart. | `docker restart` changes `State.StartedAt`; 1.3 passes again; a third identical import exits 0 with stdout containing `events_stored=0` and `duplicates=3`; `kizuki doctor` output contains `events=3`. A container renumbers its init process to 1 on every start, so a changed `StartedAt` is the restart evidence rather than a new pid. |
| 1.9 | No plaintext secret in the image. | `docker history --no-trunc` and a filesystem grep for the value of `KIZUKI_MODEL_KEY` find nothing; `/vault/.kizuki/serve.token` mode is `600`. |
| 1.10 | Root filesystem is read-only. | `docker inspect` shows `ReadonlyRootfs: true`; `touch /usr/bin/x` inside fails. |
| 1.11 | Export is a readable exit. | `kizuki export --out /vault/export` exits 0, `/vault/export/ledger/events.jsonl` exists, and it contains the string `acme`. |

Finding (2026-09-03): row 1.6 above originally read "`kizuki query acme --json`
returns ≥ 1 hit", written before this milestone was implemented. It was
wrong. `packages/core/src/search/indexer.ts`'s `eventDocument` labels a
ledger event's search sensitivity only from the connector's
`sensitivity_hint`; `connector_sensitivity` (the per-connection floor set by
`applyConnectionSensitivity`) is not consulted at index time. The
`markdown-folder` connector's manifest sets `emits_sensitivity_hint: false`
and never sets a hint on the events it emits, so every note this connector
imports is indexed as `unlabeled`, and `ceilingSql` (`packages/core/src/
query/sql.ts`) excludes anything without a recognized sensitivity from every
`query` result regardless of the file's own frontmatter. On the zero-model
floor this is not a defect to route around here: there is exactly one
receipted writer for canon, and no CLI verb or container script may write
canon or rebuild the derived search index outside it. So on M1, imported
notes are real, queryable-by-nothing evidence in the ledger, and a `query`
hit becomes observable only once M4 wires a model and a receipted write
actually lands (see M4 check 4.3). This is a candidate issue for a future
lane, not something this milestone fixes.

### M2 Tailnet access

Files: `deploy/compose.yml` (tailscale service), `deploy/tailscale/serve.json`,
`deploy/proof/tailnet.sh`, `deploy/proof/compose-lint.sh`.

Finish line, `deploy/proof/compose-lint.sh` (CI-runnable):

| # | Assertion | How it is decided |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.1 | Images are pinned. | Every `image:` in `compose.yml` carries `@sha256:`. |
| 2.2 | No key in the tree. | `TS_AUTHKEY` appears only as a Docker secret reference; `git grep -E 'tskey-'` finds nothing. |
| 2.3 | State persists. | A named volume is mounted at `TS_STATE_DIR`. |
| 2.4 | Kizuki has no network of its own. | The kizuki service has `network_mode: service:tailscale` and no `ports:`. |
| 2.5 | Capabilities are empty. | `cap_drop: [ALL]` on both services; no `cap_add`, no `devices`. |

Finish line, `deploy/proof/tailnet.sh` (runs FROM a tailnet peer AGAINST an
already-running, remote box; not CI-runnable — see the 2026-09-04 topology
Finding below for why it no longer brings the box up itself):

| # | Assertion | How it is decided |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.6 | Node is on the tailnet. | This peer's own `tailscale status --self=false` (plain text, not `--json`) reports the target (`kizuki-m2-proof` by default) as a line whose hostname column matches and whose status column is not `offline`; `--self=false` excludes this peer's own entry entirely, which is what makes a self-probe structurally impossible here rather than a hostname comparison a future edit could get wrong. Sets the target's tailnet address for every later check. |
| 2.7 | Health over the tailnet. | `curl`, run directly on the peer (no `docker compose exec` wrapper — see the Finding), against `http://<node-tailscale-ip>:8787/health` with an explicit `Host: 127.0.0.1` header, over the raw TCP forward `serve.json` sets up (see the older Finding below for why this is plain HTTP, not HTTPS) → `"ok":true`. |
| 2.8 | MCP read over the tailnet with a token. | `POST /v1/mcp/system_health` from the peer to the same address with `Host: 127.0.0.1` and `Authorization: Bearer <daemon token>` → 200, `"ok":true`. The token comes from `KIZUKI_DAEMON_TOKEN` in the peer's environment (see the Finding: a peer with no shell access to the box has no other way to learn it); BLOCKED, not FAIL, if it is absent. |
| 2.9 | Fail closed without a token. | Same call from the peer, same `Host: 127.0.0.1`, no `Authorization` header → 401 `unauthorized`. |
| 2.10 | Public IP is dark. | From the peer, a `curl telnet://` connect probe against the box's *public* address (not its tailnet address) and the kizuki port must be refused or time out. The public address is supplied by whoever provisioned the box, via a second argument or `$KIZUKI_BOX_PUBLIC_IP` — a tailnet peer has no way to discover it on its own — so this BLOCKs only when that input is missing, not by construction; it becomes a real check the moment M3 passes the address in. |
| 2.11 | 2.11 no-shell-exposed: SSH is refused. | With the node confirmed up (2.6 having passed, and `/health` re-checked immediately before the attempt so a failure cannot be mistaken for "nothing is reachable"), `tailscale ssh kizuki-m2-proof -- true` run from the peer's own `tailscale` binary must fail to establish a session. PASS only on that refusal; FAIL if a session succeeds. |
| 2.12 | Node identity is stable, as observed by a peer. | The target's tailnet address in this peer's own `tailscale status` is unchanged across two reads (the narrower identity signal available without a JSON parser — see the Finding). A peer-only proof cannot trigger the box's restart itself (no docker/compose access to a remote box), so the full restart-survives-identity assertion needs the restart to happen out of band while this comparison runs before and after; see the Finding. |
| 2.14 | 2.14 only-served-ports-reachable. | From the peer, after re-confirming `/health` reachability, a `curl telnet://` connect probe against a node port not named in `serve.json` (one nothing listens on, and one a neighbor in the shared namespace might plausibly run) must be refused or time out, under a short explicit timeout. |

Finding (2026-09-03, updated 2026-09-03): the Host-header problem below was
first hit, diagnosed and reported as an unresolved FAIL on 2.7-2.9. It was
then resolved with a configuration-only change (raw TCP forwarding instead
of an HTTPS reverse proxy); the resolution is described second and is what
`deploy/compose.yml` and `deploy/tailscale/serve.json` now implement. Both
are kept here because the diagnosis is still the reason the fix looks the
way it does.

Finding (2026-09-04): a hosted customer must not get a shell on a box we run
on our own infrastructure account — that is the main resource-abuse and
compute-theft surface a hosted (as opposed to customer-owned) deployment
creates — so `TS_EXTRA_ARGS: --ssh` has been removed from the tailscale
service in `deploy/compose.yml`; shell access is now a property of the
customer-owned deployment tier only, never of a box we run. Row 2.11 is
inverted to match: it now asserts SSH is refused rather than that it
succeeds. Separately, the containment property this design relies on — that
a tailnet peer reaches only the ports named in `serve.json`, because
userspace networking (`TS_USERSPACE=true`) creates no TUN device and
therefore no kernel route to any other listening port — is not stated
plainly anywhere in Tailscale's own documentation (three of their pages were
checked while writing this finding); it is an inference from how tailscaled
is built, not a written guarantee. New check 2.14 proves it directly, from
the peer side, instead of leaving it asserted only in a comment. Finally,
`deploy/compose.yml`'s `ts_authkey` secret already reads its key from a
configurable path (`${KIZUKI_TS_AUTHKEY_FILE:-...}`), so the same image
joins the operator's own tailnet for this proof or a customer's own tailnet
in the hosted arrangement without any image change — only the key file
path differs.

Finding (2026-09-04, topology correction): a review of the change above
found that `deploy/proof/tailnet.sh` ran `docker compose up` on the same
machine that then ran every check, and wrapped every peer-side check in
`docker compose exec -T tailscale ...` — a request from *inside* the node
under test's own network namespace to that same node's tailnet IP, which
can short-circuit locally without ever touching the real tailnet data path.
That made "the peer can reach it" and "only served ports are reachable"
(2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.11 and especially the new 2.14) close to vacuous: a node
proving it can reach itself proves nothing about what an actual peer sees.
`deploy/proof/tailnet.sh` is rewritten to the topology it was always meant
to have: it runs FROM a tailnet peer AGAINST an already-running, remote
box, takes the target's hostname as an argument or `$KIZUKI_TAILNET_NODE`,
and no longer brings the box up itself — bringing a box up is the
deployment's job (M3), not the proof's. It verifies the target is online
and reachable (2.6) before running anything else and reports `BLOCKED` with
an explicit reason on every check that depends on that and did not get it,
so an unreachable target cannot be mistaken for a contained one. This also
means the script has real gaps it did not have before, and they are
recorded rather than hidden: it has no docker or filesystem access to the
remote box, so 2.8 needs the daemon token supplied out-of-band via
`KIZUKI_DAEMON_TOKEN` (the box has no shell to read it from — see the
shell-removal finding above), and 2.12 can only observe identity stability,
not trigger and verify a restart, since it does not own the box's lifecycle.
2.6 and 2.12 keep reading the target's own status, which is legitimately a
node-status read rather than a network reachability claim — the fix is
specifically that they now read it via the *peer's* own `tailscale status`
output about that target, never via a shell into the target's own
container. Correspondingly, `container.sh` and `compose-lint.sh` are not
run from this machine: Docker is not
installed on the Windows host this branch was authored from, only inside a
WSL distro that was used for local shell experiments and is not itself a
tailnet peer distinct from the operator's own identity; both proofs already
run in CI on a Linux runner, which is the right place for them, and this
document does not claim a local result for either.

Finding (2026-09-04, second correction): two problems in the rewrite above
were caught in review. First, 2.10 had been left permanently `BLOCKED`
rather than genuinely fixed — its comment conflated the *old*
implementation (docker inspect on locally-started containers) with the
actual assertion, which is peer-testable directly: given the box's public
address, connect to it and require refusal, since Tailscale being installed
on a peer does not route an arbitrary public IP through the tailnet. Because
`blocked()` also sets the script's failure flag, an unconditionally blocked
check meant `tailnet.sh` could never exit 0 regardless of the box's actual
state — a finish line that can never be reached is not a finish line. 2.10
is rewritten to take the box's public address from a second argument or
`$KIZUKI_BOX_PUBLIC_IP`, `curl telnet://` it on the kizuki port, and PASS
when the connection is refused or times out; it now BLOCKs only when that
address is missing, which is an honest inability to know the answer rather
than a check with no route to PASS. Second, this branch's own operator
machine (Windows, Git Bash) has `tailscale` and `curl` but not `nc` or
`jq` — the two extra dependencies the first rewrite added would have made
the proof unrunnable from the one machine most likely to run it. `nc -z` is
replaced by `peer_tcp_open`, a `curl telnet://` connect probe that greps
curl's own `-v` output for "Established connection to" rather than trusting
curl's exit code (which, for the `telnet://` scheme, is the same timeout
code whether the TCP handshake never completed or it completed and curl
then just sat idle waiting for input — confirmed empirically against a
known-open and a known-closed port on this branch). `jq` is replaced by
narrow `awk` field matching on `tailscale status`'s plain-text columns
(`tailscale status --json`'s own `--help` text warns its shape is unstable
across releases, so this is not a downgrade in stability); `tailscale
status --self=false` excludes this peer's own entry by construction, which
is what makes checks 2.6 and 2.12 structurally unable to match themselves
rather than a hostname string comparison a future edit could weaken. The
one real capability this traded away is Tailscale's stable per-node ID
field, which is not present in the plain-text columns; 2.12 now compares
the target's tailnet address instead, a narrower but still meaningful proxy
for "still the same node" (documented at the check itself).

*Host header, as first found.* `tailscale serve`'s HTTP proxy handler is
Go's `NewSingleHostReverseProxy` (confirmed by reading exported symbols out
of the `tailscaled` binary; no `ProxyHostHeader` or equivalent rewrite
field exists for it). It forwards the client's original `Host` header —
the tailnet FQDN — to the `http://127.0.0.1:8787` backend unchanged,
regardless of whether the `Proxy` target is written as `127.0.0.1:8787` or
`localhost:8787` (both were tried; same header either way).
`packages/core/src/serve/http.ts` `startServeHttp` checks `url.hostname`
before it looks at the path or any header, and 403s `bind_refused` for
anything but `127.0.0.1`/`localhost`/`[::1]`. So every request over an
HTTPS reverse-proxied tailnet path 403s before routing, health included.
This was reproduced against the real tailnet: a `wget` from inside the
tailscale sidecar to its own `https://kizuki-m2-proof.<tailnet>.ts.net/health`
returned `403 Forbidden`, not `200`.

*Host header, the resolution.* `tailscale serve` also supports raw TCP
forwarding (`--tcp=<port> tcp://host:port` on the CLI; `TCPForward` in the
JSON config, confirmed as a real field name in the `tailscaled` binary's
own symbols). Raw TCP forwarding does no HTTP parsing or rewriting at all
— it is a byte-for-byte socket relay — so the `Host` header a client sends
is exactly what Kizuki receives. `deploy/tailscale/serve.json` now forwards
tailnet port 8787 straight to `127.0.0.1:8787` as TCP, and every client
(the proof script, and any future MCP harness) sends `Host: 127.0.0.1`
explicitly, which satisfies `startServeHttp` with no change to
`packages/core` and no proxy component this repository owns. The cost is
real and is stated plainly rather than hidden: every client of this tailnet
path must know to send that header, forever, because nothing rewrites it
for them. There is deliberately no TLS on this port — raw TCP forwarding
cannot terminate TLS and add a Host rewrite at the same time, and the
tailnet itself is WireGuard-encrypted end to end, so a second TLS layer
here would protect a request that is already encrypted in transit; it is
not an oversight. The alternative that was rejected on purpose: making
`startServeHttp` accept a configured non-loopback `Host` would change the
"loopback only" architecture invariant this milestone's own task brief
named as a security boundary not to touch; that is an RFC-and-owner-decision
question, not something this lane's proof or this milestone decides for
itself.

**Live proof status for the resolution:** the JSON shape above was derived
from the `tailscaled` binary's own field names and the documented
`tailscale serve --tcp` CLI syntax, not observed via `tailscale serve
get-config` against a running node — every attempt to bring a fresh node
online during this work failed because the available auth key had already
been spent (see the Auth key exhaustion finding below), and modifying the
owner's own already-online tailnet node's live serve configuration to
derive the shape empirically was correctly refused. So checks 2.7, 2.8 and
2.9 as rewritten are **not yet proven live**; `deploy/proof/tailnet.sh`
implements them and will report real PASS/FAIL the next time it runs
against a usable key.

*Capabilities vs. the secret file (compose-lint 2.2/2.13, tailnet 2.6-2.12
setup).* Docker Compose secrets outside Swarm mode are plain bind mounts of
the host file; the `uid`/`gid`/`mode` overrides Compose accepts in a
service's `secrets:` list are Swarm-only and are silently ignored on a
plain engine (`docker compose` prints "secrets `uid`, `gid` and `mode` are
not supported, they will be ignored"). `cap_drop: [ALL]` on the tailscale
service (required by 2.5) removes `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`, so its root cannot
read a file that denies "other" access even though it is root, and
containerboot exits before authenticating. The resolution is not a
loosened copy of the key: the key file at
`/home/lars/.config/kizuki/ts-authkey` is mode `0644`, and its containing
directory, `/home/lars/.config/kizuki`, is mode `0700`. A `0700` directory
blocks every local user but its owner from traversing into it at all, so a
`0644` file inside it is not reachable by anyone the directory itself
excludes — the directory, not the file mode, is what actually protects the
key, exactly as it protects every other file that directory holds.
This precondition was asserted by an earlier, same-machine version of
`deploy/proof/tailnet.sh` that also brought the box up itself; now that the
proof runs from a peer against an already-running remote box (see the
2026-09-04 topology Finding above), the check belongs to whatever brings
the box up — M3's `bootstrap.sh` — not to this peer-side script, and it
still needs to assert both modes there before its own `docker compose up`.
`deploy/compose.yml`'s `secrets: { ts_authkey: { file: ... } }` still reads
from `${KIZUKI_TS_AUTHKEY_FILE:-<real path>}`, but that override exists
only to point at a *different real key file with the same directory-then-
file permission shape*, never at a copy with loosened permissions.

*Untagged key.* The auth key available for this work has no tag; the node
registered under the owner's own account rather than `tag:kizuki`. An
untagged node's key expiry follows the owner's default key-expiry policy,
where a tagged node's does not (Tailscale's tagged-device keys do not
expire by default). M3's Box deployment, which is meant to run
unattended, should use a tagged, reusable key for that reason, not the key
used here.

*Auth key exhaustion.* The key issued for this branch is single-use, not
reusable. The first `docker compose up` in the empirical exploration below
authenticated a real node (`kizuki-m2-proof`, tailnet `taila6c912.ts.net`)
successfully; that session's local state was then discarded by a
`docker compose down -v` cleanup before this document's checks were
written. Every subsequent bring-up attempt against the same key failed
tailscaled auth with `invalid key: API key ... not valid`, which is the
control plane's response for a used single-use key, and the node has sat
offline ever since (confirmed via `tailscale status` from a genuine second
tailnet node, `lars-pc`, a Windows peer). `deploy/proof/tailnet.sh` is
written and its logic for 2.6, 2.10, 2.11 and the identity half of 2.12
matches what the one successful live run actually showed; 2.8, 2.9 and the
restart-then-reverify half of 2.12 were never exercised against a live
node because the SSH and MCP-over-HTTP checks were finished only after the
key had already been spent. Re-running this proof end to end needs a fresh
key, which this task's author cannot mint. The node `kizuki-m2-proof`
(`100.125.239.98` on `taila6c912.ts.net`) remains listed in the tailnet
admin console, offline; the owner needs to remove it.

Finding (2026-09-04/05, M3 lane): checks 2.6–2.14 above are no longer
"not yet proven live" — the M3 lane provisioned a real Box VM, ran the
compose stack on it with a fresh reusable, tagged (`tag:kizuki`) auth key,
and ran `deploy/proof/tailnet.sh` from `lars-pc` (a genuine second tailnet
node, Windows) against it. All eight checks passed:
`PASS 2.6 node-online`, `PASS 2.7 health-over-tailnet`,
`PASS 2.8 mcp-over-tailnet`, `PASS 2.9 fail-closed-no-token`,
`PASS 2.10 public-ip-dark`, `PASS 2.11 no-shell-exposed`,
`PASS 2.12 restart-keeps-identity`, `PASS 2.14 only-served-ports-reachable`
— exit 0. This is the first time this proof has run end to end; see the M3
section and its own pull request receipts for the full transcript. Getting
there needed one real fix, recorded here because it corrects a row of this
document rather than of M3's own plan text:
`deploy/tailscale/entrypoint.sh` was tracked in git as mode `100644`
(non-executable) while `deploy/entrypoint.sh` was `100755`; on a real Linux
box this made `containerboot`'s wrapper fail with `exec: "/local/
entrypoint.sh": permission denied` and the tailscale service never started.
It was never caught locally because the single-use key available during
M2's own work was spent before a full `docker compose up` completed against
the real image (see the Auth key exhaustion finding above) — the M2 finish
line's own static check, `compose-lint.sh`, has no way to see a bind-mounted
script's executable bit, since that bit lives on the host filesystem, not
in `compose.yml`. Fixed with `git update-index --chmod=+x
deploy/tailscale/entrypoint.sh` (this repository has `core.filemode=false`,
so the bit had to be set in the index directly rather than relying on a
local `chmod` to be picked up).

### M3 Box golden snapshot and one-command setup

Files: `deploy/box/bootstrap.sh`, `deploy/box/README.md`,
`deploy/proof/box.sh`.

Correction (2026-09-04/05): there is no `box` CLI available to this work,
and no pre-existing snapshot to fork from (`GET /snapshots` returned an
empty list at the start of this lane). Everything here goes through the
HTTP API at `https://ascii.dev/api/box/v1` directly — `POST /boxes`,
`GET /boxes/{id}`, `POST /boxes/{id}/{stop,resume,fork}`,
`DELETE /boxes/{id}`, and, in place of SSH (a hosted box exposes none, see
M2's shell-removal finding), `POST /boxes/{id}/commands` and
`PUT|GET /boxes/{id}/files`. `bootstrap.sh` provisions a box, uploads a
`git bundle` of this repository's exact commit (the box's own GitHub remote
needs credentials this script does not have) and clones it, places the
tailnet auth key, and runs `docker compose up -d --build`, waiting for the
same health signal as M1 check 1.4 (a `docker compose exec` `curl`, since
nothing is bound to the box's own host network — see `deploy/box/README.md`
for the full command contract and every API fact this script relies on).

Finish line, `deploy/proof/box.sh` (not CI-runnable; provisions and deletes
real boxes; first run against `https://ascii.dev/api/box/v1` on 2026-09-05,
re-run below on 2026-09-05 on the merged head that carries the `isBusy`
fix):

| # | Assertion | Result | How it is decided |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3.1 | One command, five minutes. | **PASS**, measured 49–91s across every run on both heads. | Wall clock from `bootstrap.sh`'s own box creation to its own health check passing, asserted ≤ 300s. |
| 3.2 | Stop and start keep the vault. | **Lease bug fixed, but the row is not a reliable PASS: an unrelated race makes it nondeterministic.** See the 2026-09-05 finding below. | Import 3 fixtures (`events=3`), `POST /stop`, wait for `state=archived`, `POST /resume`, wait usable, bring the compose stack back up, re-read `events=`. |
| 3.3 | Fork is a fresh identity. | **FAIL, reproducibly, for a real and distinct cause** — a fork clones the vault-id file along with everything else, and nothing regenerates it. See the finding below. | `POST /boxes/{id}/fork` is a real endpoint and does return a second box id; once both boxes' compose stacks are up, `/vault/.kizuki/vault-id` reads back identical on both. |
| 3.4 | Stranger proof runs against it. | **BLOCKED** (correctly — `scripts/stranger-proof.sh` does not exist in this tree; see `docs/CURRENT.md`). | `[ -x scripts/stranger-proof.sh ]`. |

Finding (2026-09-05, lane `agent/fix-lease-bootid-20260905` merged with
`agent/deploy-m2-tailnet-20260903`): re-ran `deploy/proof/box.sh` on the
merged head (four full box lifecycles, plus one hand-run replay of the
stop/resume sequence for direct log inspection; every box this work created
was deleted, `GET /boxes` confirmed empty after each run) now that
`isBusy` (`packages/core/src/serve/leases.ts`) checks `boot_id` before
trusting PID liveness. Two independent, unrelated things are true at once:

- **The lease bug is fixed and directly confirmed, not inferred.** A
  hand-run replay of 3.2's own steps read `events=3` back immediately (0s
  wait) after `POST /resume` plus `docker compose up -d`, with
  `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id` on the box reading a different value
  than before the stop (`cb360dae-...` on this run), the same genuine
  guest-kernel-reboot evidence the original finding used. `docker logs
  deploy-kizuki-1` after a successful resume shows the writer starting
  clean, not the `writer lease is held by a live process` error the
  original finding reproduced on every attempt. Of two full `box.sh` runs
  after the merge, one showed a clean `PASS 3.2`.
- **Row 3.2 is still not a reliable PASS, for a second, different, real
  reason: a race in `bring_up_compose`'s own retry, not the lease.** The
  other post-merge run FAILed 3.2 again, and `docker logs` at the moment of
  failure showed no lease error at all — instead `deploy-tailscale-1`
  exited immediately with `tailscale entrypoint: missing secret file
  /run/secrets/ts_authkey`, and `docker ps -a` showed `deploy-kizuki-1`
  stuck in `Created`, never started. The raw (non-retried) `docker compose
  up -d` output shows why: `Error response from daemon: Conflict. The
  container name "/deploy-tailscale-1" is already in use by container
  <id>` — the same post-resume reconciliation race `bring_up_compose`'s
  retry already exists to handle (see the earlier finding above) — but this
  time the container dockerd raced into existence first came up without
  its secret mounted, and `bring_up_compose`'s three-attempt retry budget
  was not always enough to converge on a working pair of containers within
  the 120s `box.sh` allows. This is a `deploy/box.sh`/`bootstrap.sh`
  robustness gap in a race against dockerd's own reconciliation, downstream
  of and unrelated to the lease fix; it is out of scope for this lane
  (`packages/core`, not `deploy/`) to fix, and is named here as a
  dependency for a fully reliable 3.2 rather than fixed in this merge.
- **Row 3.3's failure is real, reproducible, and has nothing to do with
  either bug above.** `ensureVaultId`
  (`packages/core/src/serve/vault-id.ts`) only mints a fresh id when the
  file does not already exist. A fork clones the entire vault, including
  that file, byte for byte, so the forked box's container never sees an
  absent file to mint a new id for — `POST /boxes/{id}/fork` and the vault
  clone it performs work exactly as designed; "distinct identity" was
  never something `packages/core` gives for free from a disk-level clone,
  and neither `deploy/box/bootstrap.sh` nor `deploy/proof/box.sh` resets
  the vault-id file after a fork before bringing the stack up. This is a
  real gap in the M3 deployment path, not a `packages/core` defect, and is
  not fixed here.

Finding (2026-09-05): **stop/resume and fork do not restart the compose
stack, and only images and named volumes reliably survive them — running
containers do not.** `docker ps -a` immediately after a resume shows no
containers at all (not even exited ones), while `docker volume ls` and
`docker images` show the same named volumes (`deploy_kizuki-vault`,
`deploy_tailscale-state`) and the previously built `deploy-kizuki` image
still present. `docker compose up -d` must be run again — `bootstrap.sh`'s
own bring-up sequence, not something `resume`/`fork` do automatically —
and its first attempt after a resume or fork reliably (reproduced on every
box tried) fails with `Error response from daemon: Conflict ... name
"/deploy-tailscale-1" is already in use by container <id>`, a race between
dockerd's own post-resume container reconciliation and this script's
attempt to create the same name; `docker rm -f` on the two named
containers and a retry clears it. `deploy/proof/box.sh`'s `bring_up_compose`
implements this retry so 3.2/3.3 fail for their own real reason rather than
this separate, cosmetic race.

Correction (2026-09-05): this document's first pass at the deeper cause —
that a resume restores a stale periodic snapshot taken before the last
write, so the vault itself comes back missing recent data — is **wrong**,
and was disproved by an isolated test (no Kizuki involved) run by the
plan's owner: a marker file written 75 seconds before `/stop`, and a second
one written seconds before it, both survived a stop/resume intact. Disk
writes, including ones made moments before `/stop`, do survive. The
`events=3` → `events=0` result reported in the previous revision of this
row was never actually a fresh empty vault, either — that framing was an
inference from `doctor`'s number, not a check of what was really
happening. Two more precise, directly observed symptoms were re-checked
after this correction, on a fresh box, with `docker volume ls --format` and
a `com.docker.compose.config-hash` label comparison proving the *exact
same* `deploy_kizuki-vault` volume (identical label set, not just a
same-named new one) present before and after the stop/resume cycle: the
kizuki container exits immediately after a post-resume bring-up with
`error: writer lease is held by a live process`, and its logs show `docker
logs deploy-kizuki-1` reporting exactly that string. The volume, and the
data on it, were never the problem.

The real cause is a bug in this repository, in
`packages/core/src/serve/leases.ts`'s `isBusy`:

```ts
function isBusy(lease: LeaseRow, process: LeaseProcess, now: string): boolean {
  if (lease.holder_pid === process.pid && lease.holder_boot_id === process.boot_id) {
    return false;
  }
  if (process.isAlive(lease.holder_pid)) return true;   // <- ignores boot_id
  const staleAfter = HEARTBEAT_SECONDS * LEASE_RECLAIM_HEARTBEATS;
  return ageSeconds(lease.heartbeat_at, now) < staleAfter;
}
```

The comment above this function (and RFC 0002 §11.3) says a `boot_id`
mismatch is what distinguishes a genuine still-running holder from a stale
lease whose PID number was reused after a reboot — but the code does not
implement that: `process.isAlive(lease.holder_pid)` runs unconditionally,
regardless of whether `boot_id` changed. Inside any container, PID 1 is
always the current entrypoint process, so `pidAlive(1)` is always true,
for every restart, forever, independent of whether anything about the
underlying host actually rebooted. Direct evidence from the fresh box used
to re-check this: the host's `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id` read
`bbe263b3-141d-4d6a-98d2-4d4cb81682d0` after the resume, while the stored
lease row (queried straight out of `kizuki.db` via a throwaway container
mounting the same volume) was `{"holder_pid":1,"holder_boot_id":"97b1007b-
448b-477d-99e9-ac1000aa0c8b", ...}` — a *different* boot_id, proving the
Box VM's guest kernel genuinely did reboot across this stop/resume (so the
platform's own `/stop`+`/resume` behaves as advertised at the kernel level)
and that this is exactly the reuse case the comment names, mishandled by
the code. This is not a Box-specific defect and not something
`deploy/compose.yml`, `deploy/entrypoint.sh`, or either proof script can
fix: every container runtime reuses PID 1 on every restart, on every
platform, so this lease would refuse to reclaim itself after *any*
container restart following an unclean shutdown, Box or otherwise. Neither
`deploy/proof/box.sh` nor `deploy/box/bootstrap.sh` works around it — doing
so from a deploy script would hide a real defect in the lease's own
correctness rather than report it, and `AGENTS.md` is explicit that a proof
does not get bent to pass. Row 3.2 stays a genuine, understood FAIL until
`isBusy` is fixed to treat a `boot_id` mismatch as conclusive (a holder from
a different boot can never be "the same process," regardless of whether its
old PID number happens to be occupied again) — filing that fix is outside
this deploy-focused lane's scope (`packages/core`, not `deploy/`) and is
named here as a dependency for M3's "value" (duty-cycling a box between
customer sessions) rather than fixed in this pull request.

Every box created while chasing this, both before and after this
correction (and every other box this lane created), was deleted;
`GET /boxes` was empty at the end of every run.

### M4 Canon writing from configuration

Files: `packages/core/src/serve/config.ts` (read `[ports]` and
`[ports.llm]` from `<vault>/.kizuki/serve.toml` per RFC 0002 §12.1),
`packages/cli/src/commands/serve.ts` (resolve the `llm` port, build
`RailHooks` with `model_ref` and `claims`), `packages/cli/src/commands/doctor.ts`
(the on/off line already exists), tests under `packages/cli/test/serve/`.

This is the lane that turns the box from a search index into the product
the README describes. It is core plus CLI, owned separately from M1 to M3,
and lands as its own pull request. It touches no contract: `kizuki.llm/v1`
and `RailHooks` already exist.

Finish line, `bun test packages/cli/test/serve/model-wiring.test.ts`
(CI-runnable), with the loopback fake endpoint from `packages/llm/test`:

| # | Assertion | How it is decided |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4.1 | Off by default. | Fresh vault, no `[ports]`: `serve --once` writes 0 canon receipts; `doctor` prints `canon writing: off (no model configured …)`. |
| 4.2 | On when configured. | `[ports.llm]` a table with `id = "kizuki.llm.openai-compatible"` (see the 2026-09-04 M4 finding below for why this is a table, not the bare string this row originally showed) pointing at the fake: `doctor` prints `canon writing: on (kizuki.llm.openai-compatible:<model>@127.0.0.1)`. |
| 4.3 | A write is receipted and attributed. | With a ledger event carrying a real subject (see the finding: `markdown-folder` cannot supply one) plus `serve --once`, `audit --json` has ≥ 1 receipt with `writer` = the loop writer and `model_ref` equal to 4.2's string. |
| 4.4 | The write is reversible. | `undo <receipt>` exits 0 and the page bytes equal the receipt's `before` hash. |
| 4.5 | Plaintext key fails closed. | `secret_ref = "sk-literal"` makes `serve` exit non-zero with `config_invalid` before any rail runs. |
| 4.6 | Budget holds. | `[budget] canon_writes_per_run = 1` with two extractable fixtures yields exactly 1 receipt and a run receipt whose `stopped` field is `budget:canon_writes_per_run` (see the finding below for why this row's original wording, `budget_exhausted`, does not match the field `BudgetExhausted` actually stamps). |
| 4.7 | Model down is not empty. | Fake endpoint returning 503: run receipt records `unavailable`; the checkpoint does not advance (RFC 0002 §1.1 E11). |
| 4.8 | Container path. | Deferred; out of scope for the M4 worktree. `deploy/` does not exist on that branch (it lives on the deployment branches), so `deploy/proof/container.sh --with-model` cannot be built or run there. This is a scope boundary between lanes, not a finding against the M4 implementation. |

Finding (2026-09-04): established empirically, in the M4 worktree, before this
section's checks were implemented.

- Suspect 1 confirmed. `loadConfiguredModelRef` produced a label
  (`<port_id>:<model>`, no host) that reached `doctor` and every receipt, but
  nothing resolved the `llm` port or called a model: `kizuki serve` never
  built a `RailHooks.producer` or `.claims`, so `kizuki.producer.model` was
  reachable from tests but not from the CLI. A model reference is not a
  model call, confirmed by reading `packages/cli/src/commands/serve.ts` and
  `packages/core/src/serve/rails.ts` before implementing, then by running
  `bun test packages/cli/test/serve/cli.test.ts` on the pre-M4 head and
  observing `serve --once` write zero canon receipts with a model reference
  configured but no producer wired.
- Suspect 2 confirmed and was a real defect. `doctor`'s `canon writing: on`
  line was driven purely by the config string, independent of whether
  extraction ever ran or the endpoint was reachable. Fixed as part of this
  lane by making `loadConfiguredModelRef` share one parser
  (`loadLlmPortSelection`) with the code that binds the real port, and by
  making `kizuki serve` actually bind and call that port, so the two labels
  can no longer name a different model and the "on" line now corresponds to
  a wired producer, not just a config value.
- Suspect 3, row corrections applied above: the illustrative `[ports] llm =
  "..."` snippet in this row and in §12.1's own prose does not parse the way
  the shipped code reads it — `packages/cli/src/vault-config.ts` and
  `packages/core/src/serve/config.ts` both expect `[ports.llm]` as a table
  carrying its own `id` field, because TOML cannot both assign `ports.llm` a
  string value under `[ports]` and later redefine it as a table under
  `[ports.llm]`. The `budget_exhausted` reject reason named in RFC 0002 §4.2
  is a producer-level `RejectReason`, distinct from the run receipt's
  `stopped` field that `packages/core/src/canon/budget.ts`'s
  `BudgetExhausted` actually sets (`budget:<which limit>`); row 4.6 above now
  asserts the field that exists.
- A finding beyond the plan's own checklist: `packages/connectors/src/
  markdown-folder/index.ts` never sets `subjects` on any event it emits
  (already recorded once, in the M1 finding above, for sensitivity). The
  model producer's `unknown_subject` filter (`packages/core/src/producer/
  model.ts`) means a model-drafted claim can never survive extraction from
  markdown-folder-sourced evidence, no matter how M4 wires the model — there
  is currently no CLI-reachable connector that supplies a real subject.
  `packages/cli/test/serve/model-wiring.test.ts` seeds events with subjects
  directly through the public `accept`/`insertClaim` core APIs (the same
  composition `packages/cli/test/audit-undo.test.ts` already uses), the same
  way a subject-aware connector would once one exists; this is not a defect
  this lane fixes, since `packages/connectors/` is out of scope for it.
- A finding about the model producer's write-target rule, load-bearing for
  the fixtures above: `kizuki.producer.model` never mints a fresh typed
  page. `resolveTarget` (`packages/core/src/canon/arbiter.ts`) creates a page
  only for `CREATE_KINDS`, which a model draft's `kind` is never one of; a
  model-drafted claim can only edit or extend a page a subject already has.
  In production that page comes from the deterministic producer's own
  entity proposal at ingest time (`packages/core/src/staging/producers.ts`
  `entityProposal`); the CLI test fixtures seed the same shape of entity
  claim directly for the same reason `audit-undo.test.ts` already does.
- Host-environment finding, not a code defect: on this Windows worktree,
  `mkdirSync(path, { mode: 0o700 })` does not set POSIX permission bits
  (verified directly: a freshly created directory reports mode `666`
  regardless of the requested mode), so `assertVaultControl`
  (`packages/core/src/vault/init.ts`) refuses every vault a CLI subprocess
  touches. This is not new: it already blocks the entire pre-existing
  `packages/cli/test/serve/` and `packages/cli/test/doctor/` suites on this
  host, confirmed by running them unmodified. `packages/cli/test/serve/
  model-wiring.test.ts` could not be run to a green result on this host for
  that reason; see the lane's handoff for what was verified instead.

### M5 `kizuki agent add`

Files: `packages/cli/src/commands/agent.ts`, tests under
`packages/cli/test/agent/`. Verbs: `agent add <name> [--owner-agent]`,
`agent list`, `agent revoke <name>`, `agent rotate <name>`. Composition
over `addAgent`, `setGrant`, `revokeAgent`, `rotateToken`; no new core
logic.

Finish line, `bun test packages/cli/test/agent` (CI-runnable):

| # | Assertion | How it is decided |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5.1 | The token is shown once. | `agent add ada` prints the token on stdout exactly once; stderr, the audit table and `serve` logs never contain it. |
| 5.2 | Default is least privilege. | `agent list --json` shows `ceiling: "personal"` for `ada`. |
| 5.3 | Owner agent is private. | `agent add grace --owner-agent` shows `ceiling: "private"`; a `private` page is returned to `grace` and withheld from `ada`. |
| 5.4 | Token works over both transports. | `kizuki-mcp --token-env` with ada's token answers `search`; `POST /v1/mcp/search` with the same bearer → 200. |
| 5.5 | Revoke closes the door. | After `agent revoke ada`, both transports return `unauthorized` on the next call. |
| 5.6 | Duplicate name refuses. | Second `agent add ada` exits non-zero with a stable error and mints no token. |

### M6 Documentation and pledge honesty

Files: this document's status flipped to SHIPPED per milestone, a
"Deploy on a Box" section in `README.md` of at most one paragraph, and
`deploy/README.md` as the operator guide.

Finish line (CI-runnable): `bun run verify` green on the head; every
command example in `deploy/README.md` appears verbatim in a proof script;
the README paragraph contains the sentence that names tailscaled as
egress outside Kizuki.

## 4. Order and dependencies

```
M1 ──► M2 ──► M3
M4 (independent; core+cli; own PR)
M5 (independent; cli; own PR)
M3 row 3.4 waits on the stranger-proof lane.
M3 "value" (canon written on the box) waits on M4.
M6 last.
```

M1, M2 and M3 are one pull request from this branch. M4 and M5 are separate
branches and pull requests because they change the CLI's public seam and
need the two review axes on their own head.

## 5. Definition of done for the whole goal

All of the following on one exact head, listed in the pull request body
with the command and its exit code:

- `deploy/proof/container.sh` exit 0 in CI (Linux job).
- `deploy/proof/compose-lint.sh` exit 0 in CI.
- `deploy/proof/tailnet.sh` exit 0 from a second tailnet node, transcript attached.
- `deploy/proof/box.sh` exit 0 with the measured seconds for 3.1, transcript attached.
- `bun test packages/cli/test/serve/model-wiring.test.ts` and `bun test packages/cli/test/agent` exit 0 (after M4 and M5 merge, rerun on the merged head).
- `bun run verify` exit 0.
- No open P0 issue reproduces against the deploy path (issue #403 lane 2).

Anything short of that list is progress, not done.

## 6. Non-goals

- A multi-tenant hosted service. Canon is plaintext under a host-trust
  threat model and the ledger's encryption seam is reserved, not built.
  The shape here is "your box, our image." Changing that needs an RFC.
- Fixing the Windows `fsync` failure. It deserves its own issue and fix.
- Running screenpipe on the box. It reads the owner's desktop.
- TUN-mode tailscale, Funnel, or any public exposure.
- A compiled binary. The image runs from the tree with pinned bun; the
  packaging lane owns binaries.

## 7. Collision check (2026-09-03)

- Open PR #402 touches `.github/workflows/ci.yml` only. M1's CI job is a
  new job in the same file; rebase on whichever merges first.
- No open PR touches `packages/cli/src/commands/serve.ts`,
  `packages/core/src/serve/config.ts`, or `packages/cli/src/commands/agent.ts`.
- Issue #403 lanes 5 (distribution) and 6 (proof automation) are the
  umbrella. This plan should be recorded there as a sub-lane before M1's
  pull request opens.
- `packages/cli/AGENTS.md` and `packages/core/AGENTS.md` govern M4 and M5.
  M1 to M3 add no code under `packages/`.
